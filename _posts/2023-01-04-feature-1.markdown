**Battery monitors** 

These provide information on the state of your boat's batteries, including voltage, current, and remaining capacity. By integrating battery monitors with Signal K, this data can be easily transmitted and displayed in real-time on NauticApp. When selecting a battery monitor, it's important to consider the accuracy, compatibility with Signal K, and the ability to connect to your boat's battery system.

**Tank Level Sensors** 

Water and fuel tank sensors provide information on the level and remaining capacity of your boat's water and fuel tanks. By integrating these sensors with Signal K, this data can be easily transmitted and displayed in real-time on NauticApp. When selecting water and fuel tank sensors, it's important to consider the compatibility with Signal K, the type of tank (e.g. plastic, metal), and the measurement range.

**Temperature and Humidity Sensors** 

Explain how temperature and humidity sensors can be useful for monitoring the interior conditions of a boat. Provide examples of popular temperature and humidity sensors that can be integrated with NauticApp through Signal K.

<br>

**Depth Sensors** 

This kind of sensors provide information on water depth, helping sailors navigate safely and avoid running aground. When selecting a depth sensor, it's important to consider the measurement range, accuracy, and compatibility with Signal K.
